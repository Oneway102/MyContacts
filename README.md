MyContacts
==========

A sample iOS App to manage AddressBook items, written in pure Swift.

Functions:

1. List of sorted address book entries
2. Swipe to delete a single entry
3. Multi-select to perform batch deletion (this is the initial purpose of the project as the iPhone does not natively support multi-delete in its Phone app)
4. iOS AddressBook APIs
